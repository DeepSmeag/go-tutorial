## Notes

### Tutorial 1

- nothing much, just how a go program is structured
- package = generally a folder with multiple go files
- module = collection of packages
- folder structure and package names don't need to match
- package main is used by the compiler to get the entry point; it looks for the main function there

### Tutorial 2

- all about types, variables, and constants
- exemplified strong typing with required explicit casting/type conversion
- go is pretty strict about types; but you get the control of choosing how many bytes each variables takes
- careful with strings; each character takes 1 byte unless it's outside the original ASCII range; len(string) gives no. of bytes, not of characters
- character = rune in GO; utf8.RuneCountInString(string) gives the actual no. of characters
- type can be omitted if assigned at declaration and it's obvious; but it's good practice to have it there in case we assign from function; instead of wasting time hovering to see type (and some IDEs don't have that), it's better to just have it there
- can omit var with := operator, maybe this one could be more useful than omiting type
- also good practice (if using VSCode with Go extension) don't manually import, just use whatever is needed and go will auto import; the alternative is to have the import get auto removed when saving if doing import->usage, which gets annoying fast
- const needs assignment at declaration, obviously;
